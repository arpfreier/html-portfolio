<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>If you would have told me 10 to 15 years ago that I would be working on becoming a Web Developer and would be doing well,
  I probably would have laughed at you. When I grew up I always wanted to be a Police Officer (like my Dad), or a FireFighter.
  I was a FireFighter for 10 years and loved every minute of it. Like everything through life it had its ups and and downs.
  But what I enjoyed about it, was making a difference in peoples life and helping them for when they needed it the most.</p>

<p>Now you read that and ask yourself, "But what does this have to do with you becoming or wanting to get into Web Development"?
   Well I am getting to that, because while I was a Fire Fighter and working this one job in upholstery, I wanted to go back to school,
   and do something with my life. I first wanted to go and become Occupational Therapist or Physical Therapist, and my family said, "go
   to school for computers, you are always on one." So I did just that, and that is where I learned and was introduced to Programming 101.

<p>To Flash Forward from 2012 to 2020/2021 I was working at a Casino and my Manager was telling me how nice it would be to clean 
   up the IT Documentation and simplifying everything when searching. So I started looking at HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   I was reading this book that I got and everything was making sense but then I stopped when I was getting into it because I wasn't 
   going to be the developer I wanted to be there. But when I started working at this company that later became SourcePass, I saw that 
   passion starting to come back again and wanted to persue it more. So i started taking this course on Udemy.com and it has been the greatest
   decision that I have ever made and looking forward to what the future brings for me.
